This guide tracks the development of an automated radar precipitation processing system across the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone using the Stage IV QPE product from NCEP.  Following the framework described in this guide, users can automate collection of radar rainfall across a watershed that can be used to track droughts, forecast reservoir inflows, estimate soil moisture, force surface water models, etc.  

Rainfall maps and basin averaged accumulation values are published daily at approximately 8:00 AM CST (9:00 CDT) here - [Edwards Aquifer rainfall](https://0199e482-e2de-af9b-8add-6015f1008ca5.share.connect.posit.cloud/).
