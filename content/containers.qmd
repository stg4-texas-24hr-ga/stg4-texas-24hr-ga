Containers is where the magic sauce lies.  Can't say enough good things about docker in a month of lunches.

## Step 2. Clone and create RStudio project

First, clone the repo onto your local computer. How? You can click File > New Project and then select "Version Control". Paste in the url of the repository. That will clone the repo on to your local computer. When you make changes, you will need to push those up.

## Step 3. Render within RStudio

RStudio will recognize that this is a Quarto project by the presence of the `_quarto.yml` file and will see the "Build" tab.  Click the "Render website" button to render to the `_site` folder.

**Previewing:** You can either click `index.html` in the `_site` folder and specify "preview in browser" or set up RStudio to preview to the viewer panel. To do the latter, go to Tools > Global Options > R Markdown. Then select "Show output preview in: Viewer panel".
