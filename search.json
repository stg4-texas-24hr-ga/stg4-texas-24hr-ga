    "text": "The Details\n\nHRAP Grid\nThe most complicated part about getting the mapping correct is getting your grid straightened out. GRIB1 files contain 1121 x 881 (confirm this number) rows in a single column. The 1121 is N(x) and the 881 is N(y). Stuart Foote gave me a perl script circa 2013 that mapped the intersections of the grid cells. I wrote a script to solve for the center of every bin. One of the problems with making this into a shapefile is that the HRAP cell size changes with Latitude. All of the answers lie in: “Coordinate Transformations for Using NEXRAD data in GIS-based Hydrologic Modeling’ by Reed and Maidment (1999). I may have read this journal article more than any other piece of paper. I need to put my shapefile of the hrap grid on a github repo somewhere. I have .csv for state of Texas that associates lat-lon with HRAP Grid ID. My shapefile holds HRAP Grid ID and Stg4 dumps center point (lan-lon) of radar bin. So, i can quickly map rainfall amount to HRAP Grid and my shapefile holds the size of the radar bin. I’ve got a bunch of interesting albeit dated literature on this topic.\nThe GRIB2 file prints a lat/lon with every row. The centerpoints of the GRIB1 and GRIB2 radar bins appear to me to be about 50m off of each other. Lin (personal communication) at NCEP, indicated that they used a slightly different earth radius in GRIB2. Kris Landers (personal communcation) at WGRFC didn’t know anything about the bins not aligning. I dropped it because the spatial difference was so small.\nThe next time I work in a new geographic location I will document handling of the grid better.\n\n\nWeb display\nI originally built a small shiny app that communicated with the S3 bucket and plotted a radar map. I hosted it on Posit Connect Cloud. Posit.Connect.Cloud is nice for a few reasons 1). you can stand up a website, quarto build, or shiny app in a few minutes 2). It publishes directly from your github repository so you can develop in the same place you publish, and 3). You can add secrets to inject passwords at runtime - so you can interact with you AWS environment with very little pain.\nThe PCC website doesn’t allow for cron jobs to rebuild your website, but it republishes everytime there is a commit to the github repo hosting the page. This is fine when your developing, but causes issue if you want regular republishing. To work around this, my PCC website published daily by an ‘empty’ commit on a cron job via Github Actions. PCC doesn’t have the ability to schedule cron jobs so my workaround was to do a dummy commit with GA so that it publishes daily.\nThis setup worked but was too hacky plus the spin up of the website was really slow. PCC had to go to AWS, make queries on the parquet, retrieve the data, then plot and bring to viewport.\nMy workaround that appears more stable and much faster is to host the .png files I want to display in a dedicated public S3 bucket ( stg4-edwards-latest) that overwrites the latest daily file everytime it’s published in the container sequence. The website is still Quarto doc hosted through Posit.Connect.Cloud, but the frontend couldn’t be simpler - it just links to the stg4-edwards-latest bucket. This way AWS does all the updating, the app is simple a pass through that adds a tabset and displays a url. It seems much faster. Yaml file and one of the tabset .qmd’s pasted below. I control how the link is cached during the write step to the S3 bucket in the map and hyetograph containers.\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Stage4 EAA NEXRAD\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - text: \"24-Hour\"\n        href: recent-24.qmd\n      - text: \"YTD\"\n        href: year-to-date.qmd\n      - text: \"Hyetograph\"\n        href: hyet.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    page-layout: full\n    css: [styles.css, styles-override.css]\n    toc: false\n\nand each tab just links to the S3 bucket (hyetograph tab):\n\n---\nformat: html\n---\n\n\n![](https://stg4-edwards-latest.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/latest_hyet.png){.map-full}",

My typical workflow is I’ll develop in a separate sandbox repo. When I have the code working on an .Rproj relative path basis, I’ll amend the code to work with container paths, build the image, place on Docker Hub. I take the container path code, Dockerfile, and docker_file_build_instructions.txt and place in this repo. Everything you need to build the code from scratch (or ammend!) is in this repo.\n‘stg4-texas-24hr-frontend-actions’ Private Github repo that contains a Github actions daily website build connected to Posit Cloud Connect.

    "text": "Notes\n\nDelivery of Stage IV data\nStage IV data are packaged as GRIB2 files are available each in 1-hr, 6-hr, and 24-hr files. The 6 and 24 hour files are summed from the one hour files. Presently, I’m working with a 24-hr file and pulls daily. I have 1-hr data processed for Texas for the entire period of record from 2002-2023 (or 2024), this is what I’ve been giving to Hatim.\nStage IV data are available in near real-time on NOMADS at :55 past the hour. For example, hourly rainfall ending 2:00 (representing 1:00-2:00) are available at 2:55. Twenty-four hour data are available from 12:00 - 12:00 UTC (available at 12:55 UTC). Data for the last 14 days are kept on NOMADS after which they are cycled off. The real-time NOMADS site is available here. Note, there are .01h, .06hr, and .24hr files for CONUS, pr (Puerto Rico), and ak (Alaska).\nAfter the near real-time file drop, an additional rerun at 30h after valid time (18:55Z) is available to supplement 24-hr mosaics if RFCs need to update their QPEs or make changes. Personal communication with the WGRFC indicates that this is done very infrequently.\nSince at least 2012 when I started tinkering with the archived Stage IV data, the historical datasets were kept at data.eol.ucar. As of summer 2025, the data have been moved to rda.ucar.edu. At this new archive location they are tarring together Stage IV data on monthly increments. The data appear to be coming available around the 20th of the next month (for example August data available ~ September 20th).\nRoutines for manual processing of the data are contained in this Private repo. It’s decently complete, but I really should go build it up since I do this work infrequently now.\n\n\nGRIB2 data format\nAs previously described, Stage IV data are stored in GRIB2 binary format. Stage IV precipitation has been packaged in both the GRIB1 format (until July 2020) and currently resides in the GRIB2 format. The processing procedures and wgrib.exe utility are completely different between GRIB1 and GRIB2. Again, could use some more documentation on how to build out historical records if I ever needed to do this outside of Texas.\n\n\nContainers and Orchestration\nBuilding an image that simply spawns a container to run a script with few libraries is very straightforward. It begins to get complicated when your image and resulting containers begin to rely on varied technology streams. Using the ‘scraper’ container as an example, pasted below is the ‘Dockerfile’ that you use to build the image. Each image starts from another image, in this case the FROM command downloads a specific version of r from the ‘rocker’ repository. This image or layer, contains all of the dependencies needed to run r 4.2.2, next I create a series of folders in my image, then I run an R command to install.packages, assign working directory, and lastly copy code from my local computer to the image.\nNow everytime I call on that image a container is spawned that runs ‘stg4_24hr_scraper.R’ in the proper R environment with the proper packages installed. This script simply downloads the latest GRIB2 file and puts it in a shared volume where the next container can interact with the file.\nBuild that image in PowerShell: docker image build –tag stg4_24hr_scraper . Run that image in PowerShell: docker container run -v //c/stg4/stg4-texas-24hr-docker/scraper/data:/home/data stg4_24hr_scraper\nYou can then inspect you container through PowerShell to see if your file downloaded.\n\nFROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.2\n\nRUN mkdir -p /home\nRUN mkdir -p /home/code\nRUN mkdir -p /home/data\n\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c('dplyr','stringr','rvest'))\"\n\nWORKDIR /home\n\nCOPY /code/stg4_24hr_scraper.R /code/stg4_24hr_scraper.R\nCMD Rscript /code/stg4_24hr_scraper.R\n\nThe order of the containers and their dependencies are managed through Docker Compose. I still build “docker image build –tag stg4_24hr_scraper .”, test “docker container run -v //c/stg4/stg4-texas-24hr-docker/scraper/data:/home/data stg4_24hr_scraper”, tag, push, pull containers manually in PowerShell, but to put it in production you’ll want it in a docker-compose.yml. These are simple files to write, in general, getting the guts of the image correct is much more difficult that putting containers together.\nBelow is a piece of the docker-compose.yml used int the stg4 orchestration. For the GitHub Actions CI/CD this must reside at the root folder of the GA repository. When you work in this .yml you have to mind your indentations, runs fail fast so it’s nice, but very picky.\nThe ‘scraper’ container is the simplest of the bunch. Docker-compose already knows ‘cfurl/stg4_24hr_scraper:v1’ is referring to Docker Hub repo. The ‘volumes’ line indicates ‘shared volume between containers’:‘local path in specific container’. In the scraper example, data are downloaded from the web to /home/data, this path is automatically linked to the ‘st4_data’ volume so the rest of the individual containers can pick it up.\nThe ‘env_file’ is how AWS credentials are injected at Runtime. The GitHub Actions CI/CD builds the docker-compose environment daily and creates an AWS runtime each day. AWS credentials are stored securely in the GitHub repo. I learned the hard way it’s a bad idea to layer credentials into you Docker Image that lives on a repository.\nAnother note, when you want to hardwire some assets into your image, for example shapefiles or a .csv, you can’t place them in a folder named /data and then link your shared volume to that path: - st4_data:/home/data. It will overwrite it. When hardwiring assets in container keep them separate from shared volumes.\n\nservices:\n  \n  scraper:\n    image: cfurl/stg4_24hr_scraper:v1\n    container_name: scrape24\n    volumes:\n      - st4_data:/home/data\n\n  wgrib2:\n    image: cfurl/sondngyn_wgrib2:v1\n    container_name: wgrib2\n    command: \"wgrib2_commands.sh\"\n    depends_on:\n      scraper:\n        condition: service_completed_successfully\n    volumes: \n      - st4_data:/srv/\n      - st4_data:/opt/    \n      \n  parqs3:\n    image: cfurl/stg4_24hr_parq_s3:v1\n    container_name: parqs3\n    depends_on:\n      wgrib2:\n        condition: service_completed_successfully\n    volumes:\n      - st4_data:/home/data\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\nvolumes:\n  st4_data:\n\nHere is the list of containers chained together in the docker-compose.yml all live on Docker Hub repository:\n\ncfurl/stg4_24hr_scraper:v1\ncfurl/sondngyn_wgrib2:v1\ncfurl/stg4_24hr_parq_s3:v2\ncfurl/stg4_24hr_daily_stat_update:v1\ncfurl/stg4_24hr_daily_make_map:v1\ncfurl/stg4_24hr_daily_make_hyet:v1\n\nThe docker-compose.yml gets triggered each day via Github Actions with the standard ‘docker-compose up’ command. Github Actions is controlled by a yml file placed in .github/workflows (path has to be named this for Actions to work). There I have my compose-workflow.yml. This took a long time to set up prior to ChatGPT, but the basic steps are you tell it when to fire:\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '45 13 * * *'  # Runs daily at 13:45 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:       # Also allow manual triggering\n\nthen a series of commands that install Docker in the virtual environment, assign AWS credentials, and lastly run ‘docker-compose up’ which starts the docker-compose.yml in the root directory. Important that the AWS credentials are managed through Github via the repository, and only injected at runtime. I still to this day have never added a new imaage to the compose workflow and had Github Actions run it successfully. Lot’s of debugging by examining the logs of your ‘Actions’ tab in the Github repository. It’s nice to drop some checkin points in your scripts in the containers to print ‘sucessfully this far’ to help know where you’re crashing.\n\n\nAWS S3 and Apache Arrow/.parq\nThe last 4 containers all interact with AWS S3 storage buckets. I have 7 buckets right now on S3, here is what they contain, later with individual scripts I’ll describe what writes to them:\n\nstg4-edwards-24hr-historical: parquet files of stg4 data from 2002-present across EAR.\nstg4-edwards-daily-maps: storage for .png maps generated daily (hyet, 24hr, ytd)\nstg4-edwards-daily-stats-24hr: parquet of daily basin averaged precipitation for all 10 subbasins\nstg4-edwards-latest: storage for most recent .png maps generated daily (hyet, 24hr, ytd). Only ever holds maps for most recent day.\nstg4-texas-24hr: parquet files of stg4 data from 2002-present across Texas.\nstg4-texas-24hr-backup: ChatGPT assisted ‘snapshot’ of “stg4-texas-24hr”\nstg4-texas-24hr-historical: parquet files of stg4 data from 2002-present across Texas.\n\nArrow\n\n\nImages\n\nImage 1 - scraper - cfurl/stg4_24hr_scraper:v1\nThis container takes the current system date and time, builds the appropriate NOMADS url based off of date and time, downloads the 24hr GRIB2 conus file at that url, and writes a shell script based off of url filename that is used in the next container to inject prompts to wgrib2.exe. Both the shell script and the GRIB2 file reside in a shared ephemeral storage volume that all containers are linked to.\nExternal writes: none\nPotential weaknesses: I wrote this script years ago. I should standardize the way way in interact with system time between all images because i do it frequently. Main problem though is if the script is run at night time between (0 - 12:55 UTC) before the most recent stage4 drops the whole thing fails. This hasn’t been a problem becasue my chron job starts at 13:55, but it’w worth considering.\n\n\nImage 2 - wgrib2 - cfurl/sondngyn_wgrib2:v1\nI took this image from sondngyn and packaged it in my own repository so it won’t go away. This is just wgrib2.exe built into a container. I execute my shell file written with the first container that supplies the commands to wgrib2.exe. The output binary to .txt format for the radar data is captured in the shared volume.\nExternal writes: none\nPotential weaknesses: I need to learn how to use Pygrib when i start working with other products. The encapsulation of the stg4 product in the GRIB2 file format is dead simple. I just export to text. File sizes cooperate and there aren’t a lot of complications of what’s in the GRIB2 file. If i start to work with other products like HRRR, GFS, etc I need to undertand details of how to chunk data, access specific layers etc.\n\n\nImage 3 - parqs3 - cfurl/stg4_24hr_parq_s3:v2\nThis docker container reads the .txt dump of radar data, tidy’s the GRIB2 .txt output, clips to area of interest (Texas and EAR), and then writes .parquet files that are partitioned by (year, month, day) to three S3 buckets.\nA note, you would probably have to partition by hour if you do this hourly, because you can’t append a .parquet file to existing data because of how it is written on the disk. Your partitions have to be separate when you are doing this in an automated fashion.\nExternal writes: “stg4-texas-24hr”; “stg4-texas-24hr-historical”; “stg4-edwards-24hr-historical”\nPotential weaknesses: You left_join your .csv of of radar bins that are in the Texas buffer with the individual radar bins for that day of data. You are joining by ‘lat’ and ‘lon’, so you have to make sure that those are unique to each other down to the decimal point so you don’t throw and NA. Seems to be working fine, but i recall some pain when working through the grid. A note on parquet files, you would probably have to partition by hour if you do this hourly, because you can’t append a .parquet file to existing data because of how it is written on the disk - it will overwrite. Your partitions have to be separate when you are doing this in an automated fashion.\n\n\nImage 4 - dailystat - cfurl/stg4_24hr_daily_stat_update:v1\nThis container pulls radar data from the most recent day (written just before in container 3) and calculates basin averaged precipitation for the 10 subbasins. Within the image, “/home/gis” I have .csv files hardwired that describe area of each radar bin for every basin. Basin avg precip is calculated by solving for volume of water in each radar bin, summing, and then dividing by total area of basin.\nExternal writes: “stg4-edwards-daily-stats-24hr”\nPotential weaknesses: Is it time saving to read from “stg4-edwards-24hr-historical” instead of “stg4-texas-24hr”? why do i convert from mm to in in this script?\n\n\nImage 5 - makemap - cfurl/stg4_24hr_daily_make_map:v1\nThis image accesses “stg4-texas-24hr” S3 bucket, and creates a tibble of the most recent daily rainfall across the EAA and the ytd across the EAA. The most recent 24hr rainfall is shown on a map highlighting the stream network. The ytd rainfall map shows the individual subbasin and minimizes the stream network. Both maps contain a semi-transparent table in the upper righthand corner of the figure. The legend in the ytd map is dynamic and will scale according to rainfall amounts (ie time of year). I’m curious to see how maps look in january with little rainfall. The 24hr map legend is static. Both maps have assigned/locked color bins. The maps are written to a long-term s3 repository with the date captured in the name and a bucket that contains only the most recent map. The “stg4-edwards-latest” bucket has pretty tight cache control so an individual viewing that link won’t cache it and see a previous rainfall map.\nExternal writes: “stg4-edwards-daily-maps”; “stg4-edwards-latest”\nPotential weaknesses: Is it time saving to read from “stg4-edwards-24hr-historical” instead of “stg4-texas-24hr” - probably so? It would make your left_join(rain_24hr, by = “grib_id”)|&gt; go way faster.\n\n\nImage 6 - makehyet - cfurl/stg4_24hr_daily_make_hyet:v1\nThis one access the daily stats written in container 3 and creates a hyetograph for each of the 10 subbasins. The ribbons are controlled by hard-wired statistics built from 2002-2024, these need to be updated manually at end of year. .png files get placed in the same location as the map files.\nExternal writes: “stg4-edwards-daily-maps”; “stg4-edwards-latest”",

    "text": "Docker\nDocker has been incredibly useful. It makes code reproducible and portable more than any other tool I’ve used. You are able to package code (or data, databases, executables, applications, GIS) into an image that includes everything it needs to run the exact same way everytime. The same language runtime, system libraries, packages, and any required assets. That image can be pretty small (1-2 G) lives on a registry so it’s easy to call. I’m using Docker Hub ( https://hub.docker.com/repositories/cfurl), but AWS ECR, or a private repo is just as good. When you call the image it spawns a container executing what you put in the image. This results in a clean, repeatable run every single time - kills environment drift and the “works on my machine” problem. Multiple containers can be linked together so it’s very development friendly. You can mount volumes like drives for persistent data. Images are shared so you can pull other peoples images and start containers. There is a lot of stuff out there opensource. Looks like people have images of MODFLOW, SWAT, HSPF. There are containers for various AI frameworks, etc. My learning resource was ‘Docker in a Month of Lunches’ by Elton Stoneman.",

The tool can regrid or resample fields to different projections or resolutions, apply standard interpolations, and perform basic calculations. It also supports format conversion, writing outputs to human-readable text/CSV and, when built with the appropriate libraries, to NetCDF. Designed for speed and scripting, it scales well for batch processing and automated workflows on large archives. The “.exe” denotes the Windows build; equivalent functionality is available on Linux and macOS as wgrib2. It is maintained on github by NOAA here: https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/wgrib2/releases",

The short of it is you get in-memory processing speeds for data sets that so large they are only held on disk. Parquet is a columnar, compressed, splittable file format built for analytics: it stores columns together, so reads are fast and selective (you only scan the columns and row groups you need), and files are much smaller than CSV. Apache Arrow provides a columnar in-memory format and tooling that lets R (and other languages) scan Parquet lazily, push filters down to disk, and stream data in chunks—so you can work with datasets far larger than RAM instead of “loading everything, then filtering.” In practice, that means querying and summarizing hundreds of gigabytes on a laptop like they were loaded in-memory, especially when data are partitioned (e.g., by year/month/day) and stored locally or on S3. For analytics at scale, Parquet + Arrow has effectively replaced CSV for me: smaller, faster, and designed for selective reads—exactly what large radar archives demand.",

Access control is handled with IAM; data governance via versioning, lifecycle policies, and server-side encryption.

Workflows are defined as YAML files stored with your code, so versioning and reviews are straightforward. Runners can execute shell steps, build and run Docker containers (including docker-compose), and orchestrate multi-step jobs across OS targets. Sensitive values are injected at runtime via Repository/Environment Secrets (e.g., AWS credentials), avoiding hard-coding in images or source. This injection of secrets at runtime has saved me a lot of grief. Typical uses include scheduled data jobs, automated tests/linting, container builds and publishes, and static-site deploys (e.g., rebuilding documentation or a homepage on a timer). It’s a practical way to automate repeatable tasks directly from the repo without managing separate infrastructure—and can later hand off to a cloud-native backend if needed.",
